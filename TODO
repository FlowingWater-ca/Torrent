CURRENT
*** Compress tracker URLs
**  Block compaction
**  Fix package and transaction checksums
*   Delta generation logic?

FUTURE GOALS
*** Create a simple search engine
**  Remove 7zip? 100 times slower than simple compression. Ratios: LZMA = 81%, Ppmd = 79%
**  Add mechanism to check tracker hashes and reject invalid magnets
*   Make log macros thread safe (strerror_s ?)
    Move comments over to doxygen

NOTES
    Using about 25MB of memory per 1000 blocks uder current testing conditions
        About 75 torrents with 75 character length links per block
        No transactions or balances yet
    Need to check how good block compaction and torrent trimming is
    Estimate amount of active torrents and transaction rates
    Most likely have to use a database instead of doing all ops in memory
    Target memory usage: below 4 GB
    Target block time: 10 seconds to 1 minute
    Target block queue: 2000 to 10,000

PLANS
    Generate a block index file (allocation table) and use merkle tree
    Determine proof of work method
        geolocation (distance) to peers (ping?)
        data transfered (proxy function?)
