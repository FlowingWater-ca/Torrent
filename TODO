CURRENT
*** Create a simple search engine
**  Add mechanism to check tracker hashes and reject invalid magnets
*   Delta generation logic?
*   Transaction signiture
*   Block compaction

FUTURE GOALS
**  Double check if 7zip is needed (currently it has good ratios)
*   Make log macros thread safe (strerror_s ?)
    Move comments over to doxygen

NOTES
    Need to check how good block compaction and torrent trimming is
    Estimate amount of active torrents and transaction rates
    Most likely have to use a database instead of doing all ops in memory
    Target memory usage: below 4 GB
    Target block time: 10 seconds to 1 minute
    Target block queue: 2000 to 10,000

PLANS
    Generate a block index file (allocation table) and use merkle tree
    Determine proof of work method
        If you claim to have served 1 search, everyone verifies 1 random search?
