CURRENT
**  Add mechanism to check tracker hashes and reject invalid magnets
*   Delta generation logic?
*   Transaction signiture
*   Block compaction

FUTURE
*   Attempt to improve internal data compression instead of using 7zip
    Move comments over to doxygen

NOTES
    Need to check how good block compaction and torrent trimming is
    Estimate amount of active torrents and transaction rates
    Most likely have to use a database instead of doing all ops in memory
    Target memory usage: below 4 GB
    Target block time: 10 seconds to 1 minute
    Target block queue: 2000 to 10,000

PLANS
    Generate a block index file (allocation table)
    Determine proof of work method
        If you claim to have served 1 search, everyone verifies 1 random search?

FINDINGS
  For large text files (1GB+ magnet data)
    Built in comp takes 0.4 seconds, 50% ratio, data import takes 14 seconds
    7zip  on level 1 takes  10 /  4.6 seconds to comp/decomp, 87% ratio
    7zip  on level 9 takes 120 /  4.4 seconds to comp/decomp, 90% ratio
    BZip2 on level 1 takes  68 / 12   seconds to comp/decomp, 89% ratio
    BZip2 on level 9 takes  99 / 19   seconds to comp/decomp, 91% ratio
