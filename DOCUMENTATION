The documentation only covers code that we have written.

To compile the documentation you need:
doxygen

To compile:
doxygen Doxyfile

This will create a dir tree:
docs
  |->html
      |-> *.html

To create man pages/latex see https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/starting.html for more details.
